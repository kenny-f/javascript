##Scope
Scope refers to the execution context. It defines the accessibility of variables and functions in the code.

Global Scope is the outermost scope. Variables declared outside a function are in the global scope and can be accessed in any other scope. In a browser, the window object is the global scope.

Local Scope is a scope nested inside another function scope. Variables declared in a local scope are accessible within this scope as well as in any inner scopes.
